										<h2><a href="#">Space System Design: A Group Project in Designing a High-Fidelity Lunar Orbiting Mission </a></h2>
										<p>This project was completed in MAE 342: Space system design. I worked on the Power and Electrical subsystem, as well as the Launch Vehicle subsystem.</p>

								<p> Abstract: </p>


									This project proposes the Cislunar Object Surveying and Mission Infrastructure Constellation (COS- MIC), 
									which aims to address this gap by providing mission support in the lunar and cislunar regime. 
									The mission architecture consists of 7 18U satellites placed in L1 Halo, frozen lunar, and L2 Halo orbits, 
									which altogether provide tracking coverage of Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), L1 Halo, L2 Halo, 
									and low thrust transfers from GTO to L1/L2 Halo.</p>
								<p>
									This project was completed in a team of 21 students. The team was then divided into subsections of two students each, with my main responsibilities
									being the Electrical and Power subsystem, as well as the Launch Vehicle subsystem. 
								</p>
								<p>									
									For the Electrical and Power subsystem, I was responsible for aiding in the desing of 
									the power budget, as well as selecting the correct battery for the CubeSats. 
								</p>
								<p>									
									In the Launch Vehicle subsystem, I was responsible for selecting the correct launch vehicle 
									for the mission, as well as ensuring the vehicle met the mission requirements for Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC).
								</p>

								<p> Because this was such a large team, communication was absolutely essential. A Slack was used and a team lead was chosen to coordinate every channel and make sure 
									that the correct teams were communicating with each other. A great skill taken away from this project was learning project managment on the individual level. 
									I learned to expand my breadth of work to communicate with as many relevant subsystems as possible, allowing them to work more effectively as well.
								
								</p>
								<p> At the end of the semester, the team had the opportunity to present the Final Design Report to NASA scientists as Goddard Space Center! Critical feedback was
									received and implemented for the final design iteration. This was a transformative experience, as it showcased how real engineers recieve feedback on high-fidelity missions.
